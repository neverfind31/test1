Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that mimic human intelligence. This could be anything from a computer program that plays chess, to a voice-recognition system like Amazon's Alexa. AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms. This allows the software to learn automatically from patterns and features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods, and technologies, as well as the following major subfields: Machine learning automates analytical model building. Neural networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns. Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand, and generate human language, including speech. The future of artificial intelligence is uncertain, but it promises to be a key part of our daily lives in the coming years.
